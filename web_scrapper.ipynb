      "\r\n",
      "Northumberland has its own unique musical history and repertoire. It sounds different to both Scottish and English music, and some tunes that used to be played all over Britain and Ireland have survived only in Northumberland. My most recent craze is nine-fours - they’re really weird, but they’re great fun to play! They’re like slowed down slip jigs with elaborate embellishments on the basic melody, but they come out as a sort of pipe march with internal syncopations and an insistent sound achieved by well-placed staccato notes. The only nine-fours on this database at present are a pipes setting of \"The Peacock Followed The Hen\" in the comments section for that tune\n",

      "and my favourite - some pipes settings of \"Lairds Of Ryton\" aka \"Over The Border\" https://thesession.org/tunes/5974/comments#comment220536\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are quite a few other Northumbrian/Borders tunes that have been submitted by enthusiasts at thesession.org, including some 3/2 hornpipes, which were (and still are) used for the double hornpipe dance. I use the term \"Northumbrian/Borders\" to mean the general area bordered by South Northumbria (i.e. what is now County Durham), Eastern Cumbria, and the area of the Scottish Lowlands close to the English border. For a lot of the tunes, it is unclear which side of the border they originated from, but it really doesn’t matter, since the distinction has been more political than cultural. \n",
      "\r\n",
      "As with the Irish repertoire, to talk about \"Northumbrian/Borders tunes\" as if the tunes have a sort of \"pure pedigree\" is ridiculous, since in practice the tunes played in sessions there are from all over the place. Irish tunes get juxtaposed with local tunes in sets, a lot of the tunes are Scottish (there is a particular fondness for Shetland tunes), and there are also close links with Scandinavia. At school I remember we used to play quite a lot of tunes from Norway, Sweden and even Finland and the Faroe Islands, and we used to take the boat over to Norway as part of a musical/cultural exchange programme between twin towns. As is the case with the Irish tradition, some tunes have been brought back from Canada and the States and have been absorbed into the local repertoire. There is also a connection with France due to its relative proximity, and some people play stuff like bourees. The Nancy Kerr-James Fagan partnership has helped forge musical links with Australia too I think. The northeast is an interesting area for music, and the people there should be proud of the fact that, like traditional Irish and Scottish music, the musical culture has been robust enough to absorb outside influences like a sponge, whilst at the same time remaining capable of maintaining a conservative element that keeps the local music alive.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The exciting thing about the repertoire of this area - well, I think anyway - is that the local tunes appear in old manuscripts from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, and it’s often possible to date the tunes roughly by looking at which ones appear in which manuscripts. It’s also possible to trace how the tunes have developed over the centuries to the present day by comparing the different settings that appear in the manuscripts and on modern sound recordings, and how some tunes have been passed back and forth across the Scottish border and between Britain and Ireland. Go here to view some of the manuscripts: http://www.asaplive.com/Archive/browse_by_collection.asp. Matt Seattle https://thesession.org/members/14605 deserves credit for his commentary on this material.\r\n",
      "I can spend hours browsing through these looking for exotic-sounding tunes. As I’m playing I like to think that if it were possible to travel back in time, I could be playing exactly the same tune with someone who looks like those people in the English period dramas on the telly.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Also have a look at the Northumbrian Minstrelsy, which is available online in abc and pdf format. The original file was compiled by piper Henry Ford https://thesession.org/members/11036, but recently updated and corrected by Robin Beech https://thesession.org/members/10054.

      "People say that English traditional music is dying out, but I reckon it’s just gone underground. People out there are still playing the tunes (and I don’t mean just morris tunes - I’m talking about tunes for snobs like me - like obscure hornpipes in ridiculous keys, and modal, ancient-sounding 3/2s, 9/4s and 6/4s), but the tradition has not been subjected to the pressures of commercialization as Irish music has. I think that soon the music’s going to grow into something bigger than it is at the moment thanks to the internet and the recent comeback made by the 3 local types of bagpipe: the Northumbrian smallpipes, the Border pipes and the Scottish smallpipes (for a description of these go here: http://www.nspipes.co.uk/nsp/ww11glos.htm). I hope it happens in my lifetime.\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For the tunes that I’ve submitted here, I’ve tried as much as possible to research the history of each tune, and include abc transcriptions of some manuscript settings and sheetmusic from my own collection, and also transcriptions of sound recordings made by some well-known musicians. I hope that people can use it as a resource. There are some really good tunes in the Northumbrian repertoire which are fully compatible for use in a set of Irish tunes, and I’d like to pick out the best of them and provide easy web access to different versions in abc, so that people who can’t read dots can download the abc files and play them as midi files or whatever. I believe that if you want a tune, you should simply be able to google search it and get some transcriptions and as much historical info as you need at the click of a button. This website is ideal for that purpose because google seems to like it. If you’re a tune addict like me, you don’t want to have to faff around looking for tunes that should be just there for you to feed upon :-) \n",

In fact I think it sounds rather like a parody of his style, with all those descending triplets. It is known to have been in Hill’s repertoire though. There’s not much evidence to suggest that either tune was written by Hill, only maybe an attribution in a single manuscript, but bear in mind that people just assumed he wrote the tunes because he was so prolific. Musicologists have ascertained that a few of the tunes that were previously thought to have been written by Hill, like \"The Stoney Steps Hornpipe\" and \"Blaydon Flats\", were not actually his compositions. There are probably more examples like this which might be uncovered in the future.\n",

      "I could be persuaded that James Hill wrote the Golden Eagle, though. Those arpeggios are a hallmark of his style, and in fact, the first two bars are almost identical to a tune of his called Proudlock’s Fancy. He often reused \"riffs\", and the same patterns keep appearing throughout his body of work, sometimes note for note.\n",

Well, there are a LOT of versions of this little number and I’m hoping you lot will share yours with us. Also, it’s another one that went round the globe, played in all kinds of places, and I have versions from some of those. I’ll hold back, as I’d rather see the likes of Doc Dow and others submit their take on this. It is also popularly used for Morris dancing, where again there are quite a few different takes on it, melody wise and as far as parts and repeats…\n",
